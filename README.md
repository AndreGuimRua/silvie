## Dependencies

* [lib3ds](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lib3ds) for saving 3DS files
* [libgif](http://giflib.sourceforge.net) â‰¥ 5.0 for saving GIF files
* [libglu](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/glu) for polygon triangulation

The decompression of PAK files is handled by Jon Skeet's [dernc module](http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/dk/utils.html) which is already included in Silvie. You should be able to install the required dependencies on a debian-like distribution using apt-get:

````
$ apt-get install lib3ds-dev libgif-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
````


## Building

Once the required dependencies are installed, you can use a C11 compiler to build Silvie:

````
$ gcc *.c -o silvie -std=c11 -l3ds -lgif -lGL -lGLU
````
